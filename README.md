## 🔍 What is this?

Welcome to your personal **Movie Recommendation System**! Built using Python 🐍, **Collaborative Filtering**, and wrapped in a beautiful **Streamlit** GUI, this project suggests movies based on your favorite pick. Just select a movie and let the magic begin! ✨

> "It's like Netflix... but just the part that actually helps you decide what to watch!" 🍿

## 🧠 How It Works

This recommender uses **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** to find similar users and suggest what they liked (and you might too!).

1. Takes your selected movie as input.
2. Looks for similar users who liked the same movie.
3. Calculates similarity using cosine distance.
4. Returns the top 10 movies recommended for you!

> It’s like asking your movie-buff twin what to watch next. 👯‍♂️
